      <description>The ImmPort team successfully hosted a workshop at the FOCIS conference this past June in San Francisco. The focus of the workshop was “Big Data in Immunology,” and included both an invited speaker session and a hands-on workshop. This was quite a successful workshop for ImmPort, with 51 people attending, the largest number we have hosted to date!  The first part of the workshop included a series of invited speakers, all of whom came from different organizations and universities, offering insights on many different topics.</description>
