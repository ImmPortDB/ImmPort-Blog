Whether you are one of our many dedicated and skilled data providers, experienced ImmPort shared data user or an ImmPort novice; we recommend you read the publication.

What sorts of information will you find in “ImmPort, toward repurposing of open access immunological assay data for translational and clinical research”?  For starters, ImmPort’s data model evolved over years based on community feedback and experiences working with ImmPort data providers and consumers – it also looks like a [fish](http://www.immport.org/immport-open/public/schema/schemaTree).   ImmPort has data from more than 50,000 subjects – check out our [data summary](http://www.immport.org/immport-open/public/home/dataSummary) for more information.  Did you know ImmPort captures data from 33 assay types and 39 biosample types?  When searching for [shared data](http://www.immport.org/immport-open/public/home/studySearch) use the filter options to find data.  We haven’t even mentioned the more than 300 shared studies you can download or the cool flow cytometry analysis tools in ImmPort Galaxy!  Read the paper.
