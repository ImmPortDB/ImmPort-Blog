Our hearts and minds are with all impacted by COVID-19, and we’d like to ensure those in the research community are aware of the high quality immunological data available for immediate use in [ImmPort](https://www.immport.org/shared/home). ImmPort is a robust data repository sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). Data within ImmPort has been generated largely through clinical trials and research studies funded by the NIH and other public-private partnerships, and all data is freely available for re-use.

Examples of data types include:

* Immune profiles of over 10,000 healthy individuals (<https://10kimmunomes.ucsf.edu/app/10kimmunomes>; PMID: [30304689](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30304689))
* Immunological data from studies related to [malaria](https://www.immport.org/shared/search?filters=study_2_condition_or_disease.condition_preferred:malaria), [influenza](https://www.immport.org/shared/search?filters=study_2_condition_or_disease.condition_preferred:influenza), and other infectious disease
* General [vaccine response](https://www.immport.org/shared/search?filters=study_categorization.research_focus:Vaccine%20Response) data
* Large data-sets from technologies such ELISA, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, CyToF

ImmPort is a recommended data repository by PLOS One, Nature’s Scientific Data, and holds the Core Trust Seal of Approval for Core Trustworthy Data Repositories.
