With 9 new studies and 7 updated studies, the latest [release](https://www.immport.org/shared/releaseNotes?version=DR32) of ImmPort contains shared data (ready for free re-use) from thousands of experimental samples. Research focus areas include vaccine response, allergy, asthma, and preterm birth. Assay types including ELISA, ELISPOT, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and many more.

One new shared study, [SDY1086](https://www.immport.org/shared/study/SDY1086), presented novel insights into how the gut microbiome impacts vaccine response in humans. Per the study summary published in Cell, researchers administered a seasonal influenza vaccine to a group of healthy adults who were given a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and also administered the vaccine to a control group of healthy adults not receiving antibiotics. Findings showed that despite a major reduction in gut bacterial load, immune response was not generally affected for those taking antibiotics. However, during a second trial of subjects who had low pre-existing antibody titers, immune response specific to H1N1 vaccination showed impairment.
