In the midst of a global pandemic, sharing of scientific data is critical to increasing our collective understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the resultant disease caused by the virus, COVID-19. We’d like to thank the researchers who are currently sharing their data through the [ImmPort](https://www.immport.org/shared/home) platform, and we stand ready to support the scientific community’s future data sharing and processing needs. 

ImmPort’s latest data release includes 13 new studies and 2 updated studies, covering a wide range of focus areas including COVID-19, organ transplantation, auto-immune disease, influenza, cancer, and preterm birth. New shared studies include:
