Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation (CTOT)ImmPort’s latest data release contains 20 shared studies, covering multiple assay types and focus areas. Three of the shared studies come from the [Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation (CTOT)] (http://www.ctotstudies.org/) and [Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation in Children (CTOT-C) programs] (http://www.ctotc.org/). These vital programs are sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases division, and aim to “improve short and long-term graft and patient survival.”To learn more, check out these key facts, or follow the links to view study details within ImmPort:

Study [SDY1095: A Retrospective Multicenter Study to Determine 4-Year Clinical Outcomes in Subjects Previously Enrolled in the CTOT-05 Study] (https://www.immport.org/shared/study/SDY1095)
<br></br>
Subjects: 180
<br></br>
Assessment Data: Graft function
<br></br>
Description: A multicenter, non-randomized, retrospective study to collect long term (4 years post-transplant) clinical outcome data on subjects previously enrolled in the CTOT-05 study
<br></br>
Study [SDY960: Viral Triggers of Alloimmunity and Autoimmunity in Pediatric Lung Transplantation] (https://www.immport.org/shared/study/SDY960)
<br></br>
Subjects: 78
<br></br>
Assay Types: HLA Typing
<br></br>
Description: A non-randomized observational study to determine whether respiratory viral infections increase the risk of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, obliterative bronchiolitis, death or retransplantation in pediatric lung transplant recipients
<br></br>
Study [SDY1295: Perceived Barriers to Patient Adherence after Pediatric Solid Organ Transplantation] (https://www.immport.org/shared/study/SDY1295)
<br></br>
Subjects: 502
<br></br>
Description: A two part prospective, observational, multi-center cohort study of solid organ transplant recipients
<br></br>
Part 1: A cross sectional comparison of perceived barriers to adherence to post-transplant immunosuppressant regimens in parents of children (0-11 years) versus adolescents (12-21 years)
<br></br>
Part 2: A longitudinal study to evaluate whether perceived barriers to adherence increase with time during the first year following transplantation
