What if clinicians could understand earlier in pregnancy which mothers are developing preeclampsia, far before any clinical symptoms emerge? A team of researchers discovered that a set of eight cell-specific immune features from a maternal blood sample accurately predicted the onset of preeclampsia well before traditional clinical signs appeared. These results are captured in ImmPort study [SDY1528](https://www.immport.org/shared/study/SDY1528), and are as always, freely available for download and re-use.

Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal death and preterm birth, however early diagnosis has been challenging. Study SDY1528, sheds light on this challenge. To learn more about SDY1528 from the Stanford March of Dimes Prematurity Research Center, see the paper “[Differential Dynamics of the Maternal Immune System in Healthy Pregnancy and Preeclampsia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263463?dopt=Abstract),” published in the journal Frontiers in Immunology.
