With 22 new studies and 21 updated studies, the latest [release](https://www.immport.org/shared/releaseNotes?version=DR33) of ImmPort contains a wealth of high quality data, all free for re-use. This major release contains data from over 2,700 subjects and covers a wide range of research areas such as food allergies, organ and islet transplantation, lupus, HIV, chikungunya, and vaccine response for influenza and pertussis.

Of the 22 new studies, 6 come from the Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) and contain data from 1,587 subjects. CoFAR was originally established in 2005, and subsequently renewed and expanded in 2010, after several promising clinical studies were conducted by CoFAR researchers.
