Our collective understanding of the immune system is constantly expanding as more and more high-quality studies are published each day. At [ImmPort](https://www.immport.org/shared/home), we are proud to provide a platform that preserves this data for re-use by the greater scientific community. Recently, 9 new studies were added to ImmPort and 5 existing studies were updated, bringing ImmPort’s total study count to 422. ImmPort now contains high quality immunological-related data for over 58,000 subjects representing over 5 million experimental results. As always, this data is freely available to the scientific community to support current and future research.

With a wealth of data from assay types such as ELISA, RNA sequencing, Q-PCR, and CyTOF, there is much to explore. Additionally, ImmPort’s wide-range of study focus areas, from vaccine and immune response to organ transplantation to autoimmune conditions and many others, provides opportunity for cross-discipline discovery and knowledge sharing.

The following studies were newly added to ImmPort as part of the [latest release](https://www.immport.org/shared/releaseNotes?version=DR34):

•	[**SDY1369**](https://www.immport.org/shared/study/SDY1369): Immune signatures of responses to infection with Dengue and Zika virus
