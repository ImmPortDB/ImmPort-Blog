A data-drive model of pediatric immune reaction to chikungunya virus infection.

A recently [published study](http://msb.embopress.org/content/14/8/e7862) used multiple profiling techniques in a comprehensive 
assessment of natural pediatric infection with CHIKV. Researchers compared the 
acute and convalescent phases of 42 pediatric cases of CHIKV from a hospital-based 
study in Nicaragua.
 
The analysis combined RNA-seq, CyTOF, and multiplex bead array ELISA data with 
semi-supervised classification and clustering methods in a systems immunology 
approach to identify changes in cell subpopulation frequencies, gene expression, 
and serum cytokine/chemokine concentrations during acute CHIKV infection. Their 
findings highlight the prominent role of monocytes in response to acute infection.
